### Frontend Features
- Responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- Dynamic routing implemented using React Router.
- Reusable components such as navbar, forms, and testimonials.
- Interactive animations created with Framer Motion.
- Intuitive homepage with hover effects and a clean design.
- Toast notifications for error handling and user feedback.

### Backend Features
- Express.js server configured with middleware for API handling.
- MongoDB Atlas database for secure storage of user and transaction data.
- APIs for managing user credits, image generation, and payment processing.
- Secure online payment integration and verification using Razorpay.

### Advanced Features
- **React Context**: Efficient state management for dynamic UI updates.
- **Local Storage**: Authentication persistence and credit management.
- **Seamless Integration**: Cohesive connection between frontend and backend functionalities.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Handles up to 1,000 concurrent users with a response time under 2 seconds.
